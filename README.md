# üß¨ RAG Laboratory Simulator

*Where AI meets mad science, and your documents finally get the attention they deserve!*

An interactive, educational web application that demonstrates the complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline through a simulated laboratory environment. Now powered by Oracle Database 23ai Free - because why use a toy vector database when you can use enterprise-grade rocket fuel? No lab coats required, but we won't judge if you wear one.

## ü§î What's This All About?

Ever wondered how ChatGPT and friends actually "remember" things? Spoiler alert: they don't. They just got really good at pretending by using RAG! 

This simulator takes you on a journey through the magical world of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, where we teach AI to be less confidently wrong and more helpfully accurate. Think of it as a cooking show, but instead of making souffl√©, we're cooking up some sweet, sweet semantic search with Oracle's industrial-strength kitchen equipment.

**Plot Twist:** We've upgraded from that cute little vector database you learned about in tutorials to Oracle Database 23ai Free - because apparently Oracle decided to join the "let's make AI accessible" party and brought some serious enterprise firepower. It's like trading in your bicycle for a supercar, except the supercar is free and has built-in AI superpowers.

## ‚ú® Features (The Good Stuff)

### üî¨ Complete RAG Workflow
Because who doesn't love a good step-by-step process that actually works? Now with 100% more Oracle magic!

- **Development Environment Setup** - *"Have you tried turning it off and on again?" - The IT Crowd*
- **Oracle Database 23ai Free Setup** - Where enterprise meets free tier (pinch yourself, it's real!)
- **Document Chunking & Embedding** - Like a paper shredder, but for semantics, powered by Oracle's native VECTOR data type
- **Knowledge Base Loading** - Feeding the AI brain with Oracle's industrial-strength storage (nom nom nom)
- **Semantic Search Testing** - "Google, but make it understand context" + Oracle's built-in vector indexes
- **Web Interface Deployment** - The grand finale! üé≠

### üéÆ Interactive Learning Experience
Learning should be fun, not a punishment from your computer science professor.

- **Step-by-step execution** with terminal outputs that look impressively hacky (now with more Docker!)
- **Visual demonstrations** including fancy animations (because we're not animals)
- **Progress tracking** - Like a video game, but you're leveling up your Oracle-powered AI knowledge
- **Responsive design** - Works on mobile too, because we live in 2025 and not the stone age
- **Working chatbot demo** - It's not HAL 9000, but it won't try to kill you either (and it's got Oracle reliability)

### üé® Professional Lab Aesthetic
We spent way too much time making this look cool.

- Modern glassmorphism design (yes, that's a real word now)
- Glowing elements that make you feel like you're in Tron, but with better database technology
- Dark theme because light themes are for morning people
- Scientific laboratory vibes without the risk of chemical burns (Oracle handles the safety protocols)

## üèõÔ∏è Why Oracle Database 23ai? (Plot Twist Nobody Saw Coming)

### The "Wait, Oracle Made This Free?" Edition

Oracle decided to crash the vector database party and brought some seriously impressive gifts:

- **üéØ Native Vector Database Powers** - Built-in VECTOR data type because Oracle doesn't do things halfway
- **üöÄ Three Flavors of Vector Indexes** - HNSW, IVF-Flat, and Hybrid (it's like having three different superpowers)
- **üîß Enterprise DNA** - All the reliability and performance you'd expect, minus the enterprise price tag
- **üß† Built-in AI Smarts** - ONNX model support, embedding functions, and SQL that actually understands vectors
- **üè∞ Converged Database Magic** - Vector search + relational + JSON + graph + spatial all in one happy family

*Translation: It's like getting a Supercar for the price of a bicycle, except the Supercar also flies and makes coffee.*

### The "This Changes Everything" Moment

Instead of juggling separate vector databases, embeddings APIs, and hoping everything plays nice together, Oracle 23ai just... does it all. It's like they looked at the RAG ecosystem and said, "Hold my coffee, we got this."

## üöÄ Getting Started (Don't Panic!)

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (if you're still using Internet Explorer... we need to talk)
- Basic understanding that computers exist
- Optional: A sense of humor (you're doing great so far!)

### Installation & Usage

It's easier than assembling IKEA furniture, we promise. Now with more Oracle!

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkowalik-git/rag-lab.git
   cd rag-lab
   # You're basically a hacker now üòé
   ```
   
2. **Open the simulator**
   ```bash
   # Method 1: The "I just want it to work" approach
   open rag_lab_simulator.html
   
   # Method 2: The "I like to feel fancy" approach
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000 like a proper developer
   ```

3. **Start your Oracle-powered RAG journey**
   - Click "Initialize Environment" (it's literally the first button, you got this!)
   - Watch as we pull Oracle Database 23ai Free (grab a coffee, it's 4.5GB of pure enterprise goodness)
   - Follow the 6 steps like you're following a recipe (Oracle edition)
   - Don't skip ahead - we'll know, and we will judge you
   - Complete all steps to unlock the chatbot (it's like a boss fight, but with better database technology)
